## Hello fellow Euler people! ##

These short Python scripts solve [Euler problems][1]. I've made these scripts public so people can compare solutions and maybe even learn something new. Please don't just run these to solve the problems, that ruins the fun. Take a look at the ideas I've used and try to come up with a better solution - it won't be awfully hard.
